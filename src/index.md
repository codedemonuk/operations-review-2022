## Performance Management

Note:

As portfolio holder for performance, I have an Executive Panel which meets quarterly to discuss council performance and discuss matters of concern.
This includes inviting any relevant portfolio holders or officers to discuss any areas of concern within their departments.
The membership of this panel includes members of each of the political parties on the Council.

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Number of community safety related partnership initiatives | 46 | 36 | ‚úÖ |
| % of Council Tax collected | 97% | 98% | üî¥ |
| % of Non-domestic Rates Collected | 98% | 98% | ‚úÖ |

Note:

For the Council Tax collected indicator:

Given the pressures on the service currently we have been unable to introduce any steps that will significantly change our recycling performance.
Our priority has been maintaining collections.
The Government has made some initial announcements around Extended Producer Responsibility schemes.
These may change the amount of non-recyclable packing that is produced, however clarification around funding issues is still required.
A Deposit Return Scheme for plastic bottles and cans is also likely to be introduced.
This will likely impact the recyclable waste that we collect.
Finally we expect an announcement shortly on consistency of household collections.
We expect separate food waste collection to be mandated and as this will be a new burden on local authorities it should be funded.

We plan to introduce a new round on week 2 of our collection (brown and green bins) to assist with service pressures which will have a positive impact on service resilience, however as yet we are unable to recruit additional staff.
As we understand the detail of the Government‚Äôs proposals we will bring forward a detailed plan to implement these and options for step change improvement in recycling.

A key part of this is ensuring a reliable and resilient collection regime. We have a solid core of established staff but are still very reliant on agency staff where we currently see higher turnover.
Issues such as contamination, bin rejection etc. are better dealt with by a less transient workforce and so our recruitment and retention plans are also key to improving our recycling rate.

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Percentage of household waste sent for reuse, recycling and composting - Hertsmere Estimate | 45% | 48% | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Number of missed collections per 100,000 collections | 45 | 60 | ‚úÖ |

Note:

For the househole waste indicator - given the pressures on the service currently we have been unable to introduce any steps that will significantly change our recycling performance.
Our priority has been maintaining collections.

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average time taken in calendar days to process all new claims and change events in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit | 14 | 13 | üî¥ |
| Working Days Lost Due to Short Term Sickness Absence per employee - Rolling Year | 4.0 | 3.5 | üî¥ |

Note:

The annual figure for time taken to process new claims and change in circumstances has been affected by pressure on the team‚Äôs workload from test and trace payments and an IT issue earlier in the year.

Short term sickness absence has risen during the past year mainly as a result of Covid sickness absence and surgery postponed during the lockdown.
Sickness absence is being monitored on a monthly basis and wellbeing activities provided to support staff in improving their health and reducing absence levels.
The attendance award was also reintroduced in April 2022 after a period of suspension during the pandemic.

+++

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Participation rates at InspireAll owned leisure facilities | 695,301 | 595,044 | ‚úÖ |
| Number of green flag award sites | 7 | 7 | ‚úÖ |
| Percentage of parks and amenities graded acceptable or above | 100% | 75% | ‚úÖ |

+++

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 'Major' planning applications determined within 13 weeks | 93% | 69% | ‚úÖ |
| 'Minor' planning applications determined within 8 weeks | 96% | 83% | ‚úÖ |
| 'Other' applications determined within 8 weeks | 96% | 93% | ‚úÖ |

+++

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Number of households living in temporary accommodation | 75 | 150 | ‚úÖ |
| Percentage of homelessness cases closed in quarter due to successful prevention | 37% | 30% | ‚úÖ |

+++

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| No of cases prevented, relieved or discharged via a proactive offer in private rented sector via Let with Hertsmere | 69 | 60 | ‚úÖ |
| Number of rough sleepers accommodated | 47 | 50 | ‚úÖ |

Note:

For rough sleepers, the annual figure of 47 reflects the number of individuals in 2021/22 who have received or continue to receive support to encourage them to successfully move on in to longer-term accommodation via the Housing register (where eligible) or the Private Rented Sector.
