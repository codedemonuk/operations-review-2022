### Hertfordshire Constabulary – Hertsmere Daily Tasking Meetings

Note:

Since March 2020 either the Community Safety Intervention Officer or Community Safety Manager attends the Police Daily Tasking Meeting, held over Microsoft Teams, chaired by either the Chief Inspector, Inspector or Detective Inspector.
The previous 24 hours operational policing in Hertsmere is discussed along with key expectations for the day ahead.
Any queries raised regarding housing, tenancy, land ownership, environmental health etc can be resolved in a more timely manner and has proved extremely valuable to both parties.

It reinforces our mutual trust and our partnership approach to community safety and is now forms part of our normal daily routine.

### Older Person’s Activity Learning and Safety (OPALS) – March 2022

Note:

The Hertsmere Community Safety Partnership and the Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service worked collaboratively to host the Older Person’s Activity Learning and Safety (OPALS) event at the Wyllyotts Theatre, in Potters Bar on 31 March 2022. Over 30 residents attended and were able to receive information and advice from a number of organisations including: Hertfordshire Trading Standards, Age UK, Beacon Victim Care, MIND and the Alzheimer’s Society. 

The event was very well received, with the majority of attendees feeding back that the event was either good or excellent.

### Hertsmere’s Safer Streets Initiative

Note:

The Community Safety Team were successfully awarded a grant of £5,000 from the Police and Crime Commissioner’s Fund, in partnership with the Hertfordshire Community Foundation, for the purposes of updating the Safer Streets information folders.
These folders provides residents with information a variety of services, safety advice and how to contact different organisations.
The information folder has been reviewed and has been submitted for re-design.

Following the recent fire in Potters Bar, representatives from the Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, the Hertfordshire Constabulary and the Hertsmere Community Safety Team visited the area on the 25 May 2022.
During the visit, six residents were engaged with, resulting in some referrals to the Neighbourhood Watch and a smoke detector being fitted in one property.

### Community Trigger

Note:

The Community Trigger is designed to give victims of anti-social behaviour (ASB) the right to request a review of their case and bring agencies together to take a joined up, problem solving approach to find a solution.
The Community Trigger can be used if a person has complained to Hertsmere Borough Council, the police and/or a registered housing provider (social landlord) on 3 or more occasions about separate incidents in the past 6 months.
Each incident must have been reported within one month of it happening. This is the threshold for a community trigger review.

Each area previously chaired their own community trigger review meetings, however advice and best practice from consultant agencies have suggested that reviews be chaired by an independent individual - ideally an officer who works within ASB but not for the local authority, Police or housing association in question.

Hertsmere’s Community Safety Intervention Officer acted as an independent chair for Welwyn & Hatfield Council in February 2022 and it was felt that having an independent chair meant there was no professional bias upon the case discussion and allowed for a fresh perspective and a higher level of scrutiny on the case management.

Following this review, Community Safety teams from across Hertfordshire and the HCC Community Safety Unit met and CSPs formally agreed to chair each other’s case reviews or act as an independent case review panel member for future reviews. 

Hertfordshire County Council have put together a Terms of Reference for the process which has been agreed by the areas and submitted to the OPCC.

### The No More Service

Note:

The No More Youth Service offers complex needs support to individuals to tackle issues which negatively impact on their daily life.
They offer intensive support to prolific offenders and those associated with gang, knife crime, anti-social behaviour and county lines and work with individuals up to age 21 or 25 with special educational needs.

Hertsmere has 1 No More Service worker who also covers Watford and Three Rivers. The No More Service cases are monitored in the South West Herts Youth Action Panel (SWYAP) which is held every 4 weeks via MS Teams and has attendance from the No More Service, the local authorities, Police, CYP Gangs & Schools Team, SASH and schools.
Referrals to the No More Service are received on a regular basis, with 3 being received for Hertsmere in April.

When a referral for a Hertsmere resident is received, the Community Safety Intervention Officer liaises with local officers to determine what information is held on the young person to bring to the meetings to help aid the case discussion and seek progression.

### Choices & Consequences

Year 6 Students

Note:

Almost 300 year 6 students, professionals and parents took part in a three-day Choices and Consequences event about the dangers of gangs and criminality.
The event was organised by the Hertsmere Community Safety Partnership and was split in to three sessions held between Monday 16 May and Wednesday 18 May, which included a one-day professional’s event and a two-day Year 6 student event with a parent’s evening.

The young people, aged 10 to eleven, took part in two days of talks and activities focused on how they can make better choices to prevent them from going down the wrong path, which included bespoke sessions on knife crime, gangs, grooming and coercion alongside advice on emotional wellbeing and coping strategies.

The professionals attended for a day to hear from experts in serious youth violence and child criminal exploitation, whilst the parents attended an evening session for advice on how to spot the signs that their child might be involved in anti-social behaviour, crime, exploitation or had joined a gang. Students from Summerswood Primary School, St Teresa’s Catholic Primary School and Meryfield Community Primary School took part.

The event was hosted by Summerswood Primary School. At the event, representatives from the No More Service, Herts MIND, Herts Young Homeless, Beacon, CYP Gangs and Schools, The Football Chance Foundation and the Police Cyber Prevent Team, gave talks alongside Alison Cope, who spoke about losing her son to knife crime and Dimtri Jordan, an ex-gang member, who talked about gangs, specifically their grooming and coercion techniques.
Feedback from the event has been overwhelmingly positive from professionals, students and parents and plans are already being made for a similar event next year.

### Utilising the services of Probation/Community Payback

Note:

Car loads of rubbish was collected as part of a community clean up in Potters Bar on Monday, 3 May.
Officers from Hertsmere Borough Council joined forces with Community Payback (part of the Probation Service) to collect rubbish on Cranbourne Parade, an un-adopted road, and transport it to the local tip.

The volunteers spent the day clearing over 30 bags of waste including a Christmas tree, furniture, tyres and other general household waste.
At the end of the day the rubbish was then taken to Potters Bar Recycling Centre to be disposed of responsibly.

### Home Office Safer Streets Initiative Round 2

Note:

In June 2022 Hertsmere was successful in their bid to the Home Office Safer Streets#2 fund.
The money, from the Government’s Safer Streets Fund was used towards measures proven to cut crime, including simple changes to the design of streets such as environmental enhancements, improved CCTV and community engagement.

The CCTV cameras in and around Leeming Road have been upgraded and we now have 5 static cameras along with the mobile cameras that are utilised in our ‘hot spot’ anti-social behaviour areas.

![Herts Community Event](./img/202203_HERTSCOMMUNITYEVENT-14.jpeg)

Note:

We have held two very successful Community Events.

Despite the cold weather over 250 local residents had a great time at a free community event in Borehamwood on Saturday 2nd April.

Local people from across the town came together for an afternoon of games, sports and refreshments, whilst being able to find out the Hertsmere Community Safety Partnership.

At the event, representatives from Hertfordshire Constabulary, Hertsmere Borough Council, Clarion Housing, Herts Mind Network, OneYMCA, Leecliffe Big Local and many more attended, providing information, advice and support to local residents on how they can support them.

![Planters in Aycliffe Road](./img/planters2.jpg)

Note:

More than 20 local people and community representatives gathered alongside councillors, council officers and John O’Conner Grounds Maintenance, to help rejuvenate the planters in Aycliffe Road, Borehamwood.

The planters have been reduced in height and reshaped to discourage anti-social behaviour in the area, as well as transform them into a colourful display in time for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

The scheme followed a successful bid to the Home Office Safer Streets Fund drawing on the clear links between a well-maintained area helping to promote communal awareness and pride.
Match funding was also provided by Big Local.

Local businesses and community groups - Aycliffe Road Day Centre, Herts Mind, the 1372 Squadron RAF Air Cadets and St Michaels Church and All Angels Church  – have each adopted a planter and suggested a range of plants along the themes of majesty, wellbeing, ecology and diversity, and memory.

## Performance Management

Note:

As portfolio holder for performance, I have an Executive Panel which meets quarterly to discuss council performance and matters of concern.
This includes inviting any relevant portfolio holders or officers to discuss any areas of concern within their departments.
The membership of this panel includes members of each of the political parties on the Council.

I will quickly go through the indicators and discuss any areas where performance was below target.

| % of Council Tax collected | 97% | 98% | 🔴 |
| % of Non-domestic Rates Collected | 98% | 98% | ✅ |

Note:

Council Tax collection has been challenging all year but worsened after the Omicron Variant.
The ongoing rise in living costs is also having a negative impact on collection.

+++

<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.2" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./backgrounds/patrick-hendry-QjTy6avy-20-unsplash.jpeg" -->

| Percentage of household waste sent for reuse, recycling and composting - Hertsmere Estimate | 45% | 48% | ⚠️ |
| Number of missed collections per 100,000 collections | 45 | 60 | ✅ |

Note:

Given the pressures on the service currently we have been unable to introduce any steps that will significantly change our recycling performance.
Our priority has been maintaining collections.
The Government has made some initial announcements around Extended Producer Responsibility schemes.
These may change the amount of non-recyclable packing that is produced, however clarification around funding issues is still required.
A Deposit Return Scheme for plastic bottles and cans is also likely to be introduced.
This will likely impact the recyclable waste that we collect.
Finally we expect an announcement shortly on consistency of household collections.
We expect separate food waste collection to be mandated and as this will be a new burden on local authorities it should be funded.

We plan to introduce a new round on week 2 of our collection (brown and green bins) to assist with service pressures which will have a positive impact on service resilience, however as yet we are unable to recruit additional staff.
As we understand the detail of the Government’s proposals we will bring forward a detailed plan to implement these and options for step change improvement in recycling.

A key part of this is ensuring a reliable and resilient collection regime. We have a solid core of established staff but are still very reliant on agency staff where we currently see higher turnover.
Issues such as contamination, bin rejection etc. are better dealt with by a less transient workforce and so our recruitment and retention plans are also key to improving our recycling rate.

| Working Days Lost Due to Short Term Sickness Absence per employee - Rolling Year | 4.0 | 3.5 | 🔴 |

Note:

The annual figure for time taken to process new claims and change in circumstances has been affected by pressure on the team’s workload from test and trace payments and an IT issue earlier in the year.

Short term sickness absence has risen during the past year mainly as a result of Covid sickness absence and surgery postponed during the lockdown.
Sickness absence is being monitored on a monthly basis and wellbeing activities provided to support staff in improving their health and reducing absence levels.
The attendance award was also reintroduced in April 2022 after a period of suspension during the pandemic.

### Information and Digital Services

- Hybrid working as a result of Covid
- Migration of systems to Cloud
- Improvement to Workforce

Note:

### Hybrid working as a result of Covid

As you are aware IDS has been going through a lot of change over the last year, as a continuation of the impact from Covid.
HBC Staff have been returning back to work and this has led to our Hybrid working strategy where staff are able to work from home 2 days a week and work in the office for the remainder 3 days.

### Migration of systems to Cloud

To allow this new way of working to be a success we have continued with the migration of our systems to the Cloud and also working to enable a mobile and agile workforce.
The technology will take some time to bed in and engineer the transition of data and systems access to the cloud, and we will also need to allow time to train staff to use the updated systems.

### Improvement to Workforce

The premises are undergoing change to develop and improve work areas, with agile working in mind to allow staff flexibility in desk sharing and shared office areas.
The office spaces will benefit from a fresh and appealing change to enhance the aesthetics of our working environment, which will have a positive impact on staff wellbeing.
The mobile technology will be a key part of ensuring the new areas allow for staff movements and we are looking forward to improved use of MS Teams and new meeting areas.

## Human Resources

Note:

The HR agenda in 2021/22 was dominated by the management of change and new ways of working associated with the pandemic, including the transition back to working in the council’s offices.
Other areas of HR work were maintained on a business as usual basis including training, sickness absence management, well-being initiatives, Health and Safety management, recruitment, employee relations case management and HR policy development.

+++

<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.5" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./backgrounds/perry-grone-732606-unsplash.jpg" -->
### Human Resources
Quarter 1

Note:

- The Future Work Design Project was initiated in April 2021, with a Member/Officer Future Work Design Group tasked with bringing forward proposals to the Personnel Committee on the development and implementation of hybrid working.
- Stakeholder questionnaires for staff and members on remote working established a baseline of views about how effectively people had been supported to work from home during lockdown and generally the feedback was positive, especially the roll out of the IT equipment and the provision of FAQs for staff by the HR team.
- There was extensive consultation with staff on the corporate risk assessment for a return to working in the Council’s offices and a revised risk assessment was signed off. Individual risk assessments were reviewed to take account of health related issues and concerns about vulnerable family members and to facilitate flexible arrangements to enable people to work around childcare requirements when these were impacted by Covid case levels.
- The temporary annual leave policies were relaxed and this was welcomed by staff and managers.
  The temporary policy on staff travel abroad was reviewed and kept in place pending a change in government guidance (this has now been removed).
- EELGA was appointed to provide consultancy support for the first phase of the FWD project and to generate a clear road map for the transition from majority homeworking to a fully working hybrid model.
- EELGA carried out an appreciative enquiry (the ‘hearts and minds piece’), in conjunction with the HR team, in which a large proportion of the workforce were engaged in discussion groups about future work design.
  In addition, two internal questionnaires gathered feedback from staff and elected members on their views and these were shared with the Personnel Committee and the Executive.

+++

<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.5" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./backgrounds/perry-grone-732606-unsplash.jpg" -->
### Human Resources
Quarter 2

Note:

- The Appreciative Enquiry report was received in July 2021 and the recommendations were shared in an executive summary. The introduction stated that “the people at Hertsmere who have engaged with the survey and the Appreciative Inquiry Focus Groups have a positive view of the organisation in general and are positively motivated to develop a future way of working for the organisation”.  
  The general consensus was that staff (and at the time Members) would be happy with a return to the offices based on two days a week in the office and three days a week remote working. Staff were looking for family friendly policies and hybrid working arrangements that would support these e.g. asynchronous working hours, hybrid meeting facilities and a generally improved working environment.
  It was noted that a service led design of workstyles and implementation was requested and that this correlated well with the benchmarking.
- Transition arrangements were initiated to ensure that staff were gradually acclimatised to carrying out a proportion of their duties in the office, with appropriate Covid-Secure measures in place. HR put guidance in place to support this and service managers organised rotas for team members to attend the offices and carry out the de-cluttering of the office as a preparation for its refurbishment.
- Enquiries by a potential tenant wishing to access office space in the Civic Offices became a driver for change towards hybrid working as a way of releasing space and offered the prospect of income that could help offset the necessary investment in the refurbishment of the office.

+++

<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.5" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./backgrounds/perry-grone-732606-unsplash.jpg" -->
### Human Resources
Quarter 3

Note:

- Draft proposals of Heads of Service for service led hybrid working arrangements, were reported to the Personnel Committee and noted.
  The views of the Managing Director, which did not favour a service led approach, were also reported to the Personnel Committee and noted.
- The appointment of Move Works space planning consultancy and the programme of action they would be facilitating, was reported to the Personnel Committee and noted.
- Hybrid working arrangements were planned to be phased in from 1 October 2021, on 2 days a week initially and a revised corporate risk assessment prepared to support this.
  Feedback from consultation showed that staff were concerned and anxious about the pace of change, in particular the imminent return to the offices.
  Ultimately, this was pushed back by the Omicron variant and further government directives to work from home where possible.
- The Personnel Committee was advised of the potential impact on recruitment and retention being a primary reason for developing an effective hybrid working model, given the market for specialist skills being extremely competitive (candidate driven market).
  An audit of recruitment and retention was proposed.

+++

<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.5" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./backgrounds/perry-grone-732606-unsplash.jpg" -->
### Human Resources
Quarter 4

Note:

- The review of the Workforce Strategy 2019-2022 was postponed from March 2022 to March 2023.
- A draft outline Workforce Plan for 2022/23  was approved by the Personnel Committee in February, subject to the outcome of consultation with staff and the approval of any financial implications by the Executive or full Council, as appropriate.
  The plan focused on a limited range of priorities including the annual pay award and pay reviews in 2022/23; the development of a Hybrid Working Policy; a review of recruitment and retention and a continued focus on sickness absence management.
- Following extensive consultation with staff, an improved pay award of 4% was agreed in February and subsequently ratified by full Council as part of the Pay Policy Statement 2022/23.
  The pay award was paid in the April pay run. EELGA recommended that the Council should join the Infinistats on-line pay benchmarking scheme developed by London Boroughs and used by 50% of all local authorities in the South East region as well as 100% of London authorities.
  Hertsmere is the first local authority in the East of England region to join this and it is hoped will be enabled to conduct its own pay reviews (in tranches starting with Environmental Health, Planning and Asset Management roles) based on access to the data.
- A raft of recruitment and retention initiatives developed initially to address HGV driver shortages in Street Scene were adapted for wider use in the Council and these policies were approved by the Personnel Committee in April.
  It was noted that staff turn over was around 11% in the 12 months to the end of January 2022 but that anecdotal evidence suggested it could be rising and would need to be closely monitored.
  The outcomes of the SIAS audit of Recruitment and Retention were received at the end of March and are referenced in the Update on the Workforce Plan report to the June Personnel Committee.
- From 31 January 2022, staff returned to working in the Council’s offices a minimum of 2 days a week and this increased to 3 days a week from 1 April 2022, with the lifting of government restrictions on Covid.
  A new Hybrid Working Policy has been drafted (in line with the specific instructions of the Managing Director) and this is currently the subject of consultation with staff.
  There has not yet been an outcome from the SIAS audit of time recording and staff performance management systems in 2021/22.
  However, a great deal of work has been done by HR providing regular reports to the SMT, including a ‘location tracker’ report to confirm that officers are in working in the offices at least 3 days a week pro rata and that they are not being allowed to take annual leave on ‘office days’ as a way round the requirement.
- Sickness levels have increased in recent months and the report on sickness absence addresses some of the reasons for this (primarily Covid related and surgical interventions that had been postponed during the peaks of the pandemic).
  The zero sickness pay award was re-introduced with effect from 1 April 2022 and it is hoped that this will assist in reducing short term sickness absence levels.

### Staffing Capacity

Note:

The corporate risk assessment on staffing capacity has recently been increased to reflect the external market.
There is a risk that the recruitment/retention measures will not be sufficient to reduce this risk significantly.
Most other employers are facing the same problems and employing the same remedies to tackle them.
It is unlikely that any one of our measures will secure the desired changes but a combination of measures, together with good general employment policies, may minimise the risk to organisational capacity.
It is the overall offer from the employer that is weighed in the minds of job seekers in the current employment market and therefore these measures must be seen as components in a coherent overall marketing strategy.
